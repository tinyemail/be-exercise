2. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes two lists of the same type and merges them into a single list. This method alternates the elements of each list.

3. Write a Java program to create a lambda expression to multiply and sum all elements in a list of integers.

4. Write a Java program to count the number of strings in a list that start with a specific letter using streams.  

5. Having a list of objects Students (name, speciality (ex: Engineering,Medicine,Business,ComputerScience), age) return the statistics of speciality: how many students are studying it using streams.

6.Write a Java program to create a base class Shape with methods draw() and calculateArea(). Create two subclasses Circle and Cylinder. Override the draw() method in each subclass to draw the respective shape. In addition, override the calculateArea() method in the Cylinder subclass to calculate and return the total surface area of the cylinder.

7. Write a method that checks if there is at least on pair of numbers which sum equals target.

arr=[1, 3, 4] and target=5 result is true because the pair (1,4) sums to five.
public Boolean sumsToTarget(Integer[] arr, Integer target)() 

8. Having 2 tables Student(id,name, age, speciality),Class(id, name), StudentClass(id, student_id, class_id, grade) 
     write Sql queries:
        1. To fetch all students that belong to a specific class
        2. Fetch average grade for each class
        3. Fetch all the students that have greater grade than the average per class they attend
