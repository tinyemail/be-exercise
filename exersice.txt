Java Developer coding task

Coding challenge task is to create backend for a simple "marketing" application:
* Client should be able to sign-in/sign-up with email & password
* Client should be able to create an email campaign and send it
	- Keep the email campaign model simple, it can have: Name,Subject, Email Body, List of subscribers
	- No SMTP or other protocol must be used for sending emails, a simple mock service is enough or in memory data structure
* Client should be able to see his campaigns data: status, body, subscribers (wheo received email, who not)

You should create database structure, backend and REST API.

Technology stack
* Java 8 or higher
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL or any in-memory database (like H2/HSQLDB)
* Docker/Docker-Compose (optional)

Note: Spring security usage is not necessary.

What we will take into consideration on final valuation:
- How well business requirements are understood
- Data model
- How the code is organized and layered
- Quality of the code
- Test coverage (is a plus)
- Additional tools/libs (is a plus)
