Design/Code an application

Design/Coding challenge task is to create backend for a simple "marketing" application:
* Having next business entities Client + Campaign
* Client should be able:
   - Create campaign
   - List campaigns
   - Send campaign
* Keep the email campaign model simple, it can have: Name, Subject, Status, Email Body, List of Subscribers, etc.
* No SMTP or other protocol must be used for sending emails, a simple mock service.

You should design the application that will serve the up mentioned business requirements.

Technology stack:
* Java 8 or higher + Spring Boot
* Data storage: is up to the candidate ...
* Type of application is up to the candidate ...
*

Note: Spring security usage is not necessary.

What we will take into consideration on final valuation:
- How well business requirements are understood
- Data model
- How the code is organized and layered
- CI/CD
- System infrastructure
- Quality of the code
- Cost considerations
- Scalability
- Resilient
- Test coverage (is a plus)
- Additional tools/libs (is a plus)
